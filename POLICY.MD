# Guidelines for Remain B.V. Logos & Trademarks

## Purpose:

This Policy defines the allowable use of Remain B.V. ("Remain") names, marks and logos 
(referred to herein generally as "Trademarks"). The Policy is intended to protect the
Remain Trademarks and to promote and improve the consistency of use of Remain trademarks. 

Remain owns all 'Remain' related Trademarks and related rights.

If you have any questions regarding this Policy, wish to report an infringement of our
trademarks, or wish to use a Remain trademark in a way not explicitly provided for in
this Policy, then contact us by sending an email to info@remainsoftware.com.

## Our goals in establishing this Policy are:

The Remain trademarks are symbols of the quality and support that people have come
to associate with Remain. To ensure that the Remain Trademarks continue to serve
these functions, we need to keep control over their use. Along these lines, we want
to ensure that the use of our Trademarks is not likely to lead to confusion with other
marks. By this we mean that people should be able to tell when something is from Remain
or one of the Remain partners.
    
We want to encourage our Trademarks to be used in approved ways. For example, we want
to make it as simple as possible for our Partners to use the 'Remain Partner' logo.
However, we also want to make sure that the Remain Trademarks are not used in a way 
that falsely suggests Remain's affiliation with, or endorsement of, a third party.

# General Usage of Trademarks

Our trademarks may never be used in a disparaging manner in relation to Remain, its partners or
its technology.

Derivative works of the Trademarks are not allowed.
    
The Remain logos and production specifications are available from 
https://github.com/remainsoftware/artwork/. Use of these logos must follow these specifications.
Use of the Trademarks is not permitted unless authorized in writing by Remain. Permission
to use the Trademarks can be obtained by sending you request to info@remainsoftware.com.
Permission to use with conditions will be replied back to you. Permission to use is only valid
in the context described in the request.

For example if you want to use the Trademarks in an article about DevOps, your request may look like this:

    Dear Remain,
    
    We would like to use your Trademark, specifically the OpenAPI Studio Logo, in an article about
    DevOps to be published Jan, 24, 2020.
    
When we grant a request like this, you may only use the Trademarks in its described context.

## Proper Usage of 'Remain' Trademarks

The 'Remain' Trademarks are the intellectual property of Remain and must be identified
as such.  All logos are provided for use under the terms of this Policy. Use of the 
'Remain' name or Remain logos are restricted to identifying Remain Partners, Remain, 
and their products and services.

All Trademarks cannot be modified in any way without the advanced written permission 
(email is permissible) of Remain. Any party that wishes to seek such permission may
do so by sending an email to info@remainsoftware.com.

Unless otherwise agreed to in advance in writing (which may be in email form) by 
Remain, the following restrictions apply:

You may not incorporate the Trademark into the name of your company or
software product name. If you have a software product that works with Remain
technology without written permission.
    
You may not include the Trademark in the name of a publication, certification
program, domain name or book.
