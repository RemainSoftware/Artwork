## Gravity

The second element is a box with the logo color, indicating a defined process. The box is never used on its own.

The third element, the "G" of "Gravity" but this time it is rotated. When this arrow is used on it's own its color is the log color. It can be used for icons and such.

When used inside the box, the color is white. The combination of the box and the white rotated "G" may be used on its own.
