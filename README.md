# Gravity
The full logo of Remain's workflow solution contains three main elements. The first Element is the word "Gravity". The G is an artistic expression of an arrow indicating a cycle in a workflow.

The second element is a box with the logo color, indicating a defined process. The box is never used on its own.

The third element, the "G" of "Gravity" but this time it is rotated. When this arrow is used on it's own its color is the logo color. It can be used for icons and such.

When used inside the box, the color is white. The combination of the box and the white rotated "G" may be used on its own.

# OpenAPI Studio
The OpenAPI studio logo is made out of two styled "curly brackets", indicating a JSon object and a styled "3" indicating support for the OAS3 specification. Please note that there is a white outline in the "3" that is not visible on a white background.

Launcher icons (used as an icon to start a program) are combined of a dark blue circle with the styled "3" in white. The "3" looks fatter in this image because of the now visible outline.
